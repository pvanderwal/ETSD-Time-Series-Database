# <-- first character in file defines the comment character
# any line starting with comment character (in this case '#') is ignored when parsing config file
# Config file setup
# blank lines are also ignored

# There are two main programs that use ETSD config files: edd and etsdCmd
# Both edd and etsdCmd allow user defined config strings that can be passed to various functions.  
# edd configuration statements use a ':' as a delimiter between the key and value, while etsdCmd statements use an '=' as a delimiter.
# This allows both types of configuration statements to be in the same file without interfering with each other.
# Some statements can be used by both, these statements contain both types of delimiters with the ':' first and then '=', e.g. ":=" 

#  Name and location of ETSD file. 
# Shared version used by both edd and etsd
E:=/var/db/garage.tsd
#
# edd only version
# ET:/var/db/garage.tsd
#
# etsdCmd only version
# E=/var/db/garage.tsd

###### source plugin(s) #######
                             
# Must have at least 1 source, but no more than 4.
# The first source listed, is for ETSD source type 0, second source listed is for ETSD source type 1, etc.
# First source(0) plugin controls ETSD interval timing.  All other sources have a most 1 second to respond when queried and indicate 'not ready'
# Source 0 and 1 can also indicate that they have been reset, which will be indicated in the ETSD file.  Currently this isn't supported for
# sources 2 or 3.
# For each source you must specify a name (SN:) which is the path/filename of the plugin to load.  This must be the first line of each source stanza
# Keys 'SC:', 'SP:', and 'SW:' refer to the preceeding 'SN:', these lines are optional/determined by plugin

# ECM-1240 plugin
#SN:/path/to/esrECM.so
SN:/usr/local/lib/libesrECM.so

# SC: config string [optional]
SC:/shmECM

# Data Source [optional ]string is passed to plugin. Could be serial port, IP port, etc.
SP:/dev/garage

# Time in seconds that first source plugin is allowed to wait for new data. First source plugin controls timing for ETSD.
# 2nd, 3rd, and 4th plugins aren't allowed to wait, they either present most recent data or return error=timeout.
# Note: sleep time (interval time) is defined in ETSD header.

###### External Data Output (EDO) plugin. ###### 

# EDO allows sending selected data to an external database, cloud service, etc.
# if using, Plugin name (DN:) is required.  Everything else is optional/depends on the plugin
# if DN is defined then load label blob and create labels array, then labels blob will be freed.
# by default the labels array will also be freed after readConfig()

#DN:/path/to/edoPlugin.so
DN:/usr/local/lib/libedoRRD.so

#DC: passed to edoSetup() as *config. 

#DD: file/url/etc. passed to edoSetup as *destination
DD:/tmp/garage.rrd

#DL:1 Load channel names, 1 = load channel names from ETSD and create chanNames[] array, 0(default)  = don't load names.  
#DK:1 Keep chanNames, 1 = maintain array even after readConfig() exits, 0(default) = free memory assigned to chanNames array

###### xData Input plugin. ############ 

#XN:/path/to/xDataIn_plugin
#XC: xData config array [optional] supports Config variables
